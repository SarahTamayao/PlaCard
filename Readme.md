## Lab 1

### App Description
This is an app that helps learners master concepts by using double sided cards. A card has a question on a side and an answer on the other. 


This first Lab was mainly based on finding a way to display the question without the answer being shown. For this to be done, at first, the answer was placed behind the question for display.Then the question was hidden to display only the answer.
